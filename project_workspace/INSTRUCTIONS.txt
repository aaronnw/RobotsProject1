project_workspace created as a catkin workspace by the instructions here: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace

project setup based on http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_roslaunch#FindingWorldFilesOnYourComputer


To run the launch files:

Run catkin_make


roslaunch proj1_pkg proj1_hallway.launch
OR 
roslaunch proj1_pkg proj1_room.launch

rosrun proj1_pkg control_robot.py


If ros can't find things run "source devel/setup.sh"
If this gives a path error, edit the path to the workspace in setup.sh
