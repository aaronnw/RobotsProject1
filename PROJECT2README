Here's how to get the robot up and running for project 2.

0. Make sure the ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME are correct. See wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Network%20Configuration

1. ssh into the turtlebot's computer
	> ssh student@[the computer's name] -Y

2. on two different terminals ssh'd in, run the following:
	> roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch --screen
this boots the robot's movement and base sensors
	> roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch
this boots the robot's camera sensors

3. run python script of choice
